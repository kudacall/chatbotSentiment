Justin,
 
This is great news.  I am looking forward to your help with everything that we have planned.  Each day brings more opportunities for us, and if we keep building the right team and organization, then the market is there for us to succeed.
 
I am actually traveling to Houston on 8/27 to meet with a client for what would potentially be our largest project to date.  I could arrange to have you come to the Atlanta office on 8/27 for the half day or so it takes for startup paperwork, orientation, drug test, etc. or we could have your first day be the next available day that you would like to start.
 
Without me being there, it may be difficult to get you started on some of the tasks that I have planned for you, so I would not want you to spend part of your first day without much to do.  Let me know if you would prefer planning on a half day on 8/27 for onboarding activities or if you would just prefer starting on your next available day?
